## More design

I got a bit further with the Salcedo site design. I need to work on the Practice pages and either navigate to these pages as separate things or open them in a overlay-type page (still learning semantics). I asked to meet with Betsy but haven't heard back fom her. I think I'm going to take a break from designing until next Monday. I want to get back into using Tailwind.

Oh... and I bought a standing desk. This sitting all day thing is no bueno. I decided that I'm going to start rock-climbing again. At least go to the rock-climbing gym for now. I need to keep somewhat active if I'm going to be coding and designing as much as I have been. It's something to keep in mind going forward.
