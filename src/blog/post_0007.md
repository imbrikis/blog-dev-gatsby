## Frustration turned triumph

I was studying up on Class-based components in React to understand lifecycle methods. I ran across a ton of free public APIs and found one that I really liked; trefle.io. It's a database of plants. So I signed up and started trying to use the API. I was running into an issue where I could not get the data back from a GET request to the API due to CORS. I researched the issue but was unable to get it to work. It was late. I was tired.

So I started working on it today, with fresh eyes and a positive spirit. Then the frustration crept in as I ran into the same problems as last night. I was about to just give up and scrap the idea when I found a solution. I added the API endpoint URL to my package.json file as a proxy address:

```
"proxy": "https://trefle.io"
```

It worked! I was overjoyed and felt a tony triumph over an issue that I'll probably laugh at in the next few months. I now need to read up more on CORS and why this happens. You'd think I would have got it by now, seeing as how I had to read through countless documentation articles and forums. I'll throw it on the to-do list and come back to it later this week.

Twas a good day :)
