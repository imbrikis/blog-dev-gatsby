## A new client!!!

I landed my first gig today! I'm going to be redesigning a website for
an old client. I had designed and developed her current site back in 2016. It looks way dated and needs a lil sprucing up. I contacted her,
setup a meeting, and agreed to redesign her site. AND get this - it's
PAID! This will be a great addition to my portfolio, fingers-crossed.
Now it's on to the design. I started by using the EOT site as a
template. It might as well go to use. I also learned a little bit
about microservice architecture - creating DBs for each microservice
and setting up events that communicate when the data has changed for
each microservice. I also worked through an eCommerce MERN stack
tutorial. The end result should look craaaazy! However, I need to
familiarize myself with Express a bit more. Ohhhhh... and I learned
some new things in Figma. Like Auto-sizing (this is way cool!!!).
It'll come in handy for the Salcedo site.
