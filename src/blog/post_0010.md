## CSS is sometimes fun... sometimes not

Oh man. I ran into an issue today with CSS. I spun up a quick code pen to review the Javascript toggle class method. I attached a click event handler to a div that would expand the clicked on div via a class that would be toggled on or off. In addition, I wanted the class to toggle if the containing element or body was clicked. I found that I could not get this to occur properly. When firing the event on the div, the containing div event would also fire. I created a separate repo to investigate this more closely and document my progress. I copied my code from CodePen into the new repo. I'll dig into this a bit further tomorrow.
