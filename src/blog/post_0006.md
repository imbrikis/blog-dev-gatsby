## A moment to breath

Studied a bit of React. I'm having trouble understanding some advanced concepts such as custom hooks, when to create separate components, refs, etc.

I finally understand the useContext hook. It's funny, but everytime I think to myself "well they should add that feature to React" I end up discovering that feature right after.

I also now understand named exports. Good stuff. Tomorrow needs to be more productive. It was nice to take a small breather from my studies, but I feel like I need to get back to it. I can breath after I get a job. Haha
