## Progress?

I studied Gatsby today by building a portfolio. Specifically, the difference between page and static queries, when to use them, and graphql filtering. I used Strapi for the CMS. It's a work in progress but should be a decent project when complete. I ran into a strange issue where babel was giving me grief after attempting to update Gatsby to version 3.0. AFter the update, I could not get my graphql tables to populate. I eventually just reverted my changes to a previous commit. Weird issue but at least it's no longer a thing.

`Gatsby, Strapi`
