## Designing all the things

I designed the landing page for the Salcedo site. Betsy liked it! I was nervous that she may not have. All that self-doubt.... lol

I started designing my portfolio site and came up with a cool idea. However, it looks like this may need to get backburnered so that I can quickly create a temporary portfolio site. That'll happen tomorrow.

I was contacted by the recruiter today. He wants to chat about my resume Monday morning. That'll be really cool. He must see a ton of resumes. I'm hoping he's impressed by mine. I worked hard on that.

I started using Tailwind CSS today, per David's recommendation.

Holy. Moly.

I love it! It makes so much more sense to use CSS in this way. More to come tomorrow.

`Figma, Tailwind CSS`
