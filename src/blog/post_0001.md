## Design is dumb sometimes

Today was trying. Very trying. I did a bit of studying of CSS modules
and implemented them in a small project. They seem suitable only for
small projects. I created a separate CSS Module for each React
component. This ended up creating a ton of Modules. I'm sure there's a
better way. I also looked into Material UI and React Bootstrap. They
seem cool. I think I prefer React Bootstrap. Still much to learn. Oh,
and I built this Blog. It's unorganized at the moment, and is storing
my blogs in a Blog.js component. Obviously, it will not stay this way,
but it's something to document my progress. I'll fix this up at a
later date but will keep posting here daily.
